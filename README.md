# Komunidad Founcation

The Komunidad Foundation, a non-profit organization, has successfully partnered with various companies, communities, 
and organizations in the Philippines to achieve its goal of helping marginalized communities. Through these partnerships, 
the foundation has been able to provide access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and education, to those who are in dire need of support. 
The foundation's partners have contributed not only financially, but also through volunteering and sharing their resources, skills, and expertise. 
With the help of these partnerships, the Komunidad Foundation has been able to make a significant impact in the lives of many Filipinos who are living in poverty.
